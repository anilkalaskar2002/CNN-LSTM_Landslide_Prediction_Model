Landslides are a prevalent and devastating natural hazard in mountainous regions, particularly in high- risk areas such as Uttarakhand and Meghalaya, India, where factors like intense rainfall, steep slopes, and changing land cover significantly contribute to landslide occurrences. Traditional ground-based monitoring methods provide limited coverage and scalability, underscoring the need for a more extensive and real-time approach to landslide prediction. This study addresses this gap by developing an advanced predictive model using neural network architectures and multi-source satellite data, including Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from Sentinel-1 for ground deformation, optical imagery from Sentinel- 2 for vegetation and land cover analysis, and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for slope assessment. Additionally, rainfall data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission was integrated to evaluate precipitation as a potential landslide trigger.
Through a comparative analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, we found that the CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieved superior performance, with an F1 score of 0.91. This model effectively captures both spatial and temporal patterns, enabling early detection of landslide-prone conditions and surpassing the predictive accuracy of traditional methods. The proposed approach provides a scalable solution for real- time, large-scale monitoring, with the potential to enhance disaster preparedness and resilience in vulnerable communities. By advancing landslide prediction capabilities, this model contributes a valuable tool for proactive risk management and offers significant potential for integration into regional early warning systems.
